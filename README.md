# Week #3

Some progress I made in CAD this week is getting all the materials fastened onto the handgun. I put on all the nuts and screws.
One obstacle i had to overcome was making the holes for the materials. I had to make sure they were the right size and in the correct place.

# Week #4 

The project is going pretty good so far. I think the project is well the way it is. 
When I return from spring break, the first thing im going to do is start lazer cutting.
